# React props
A basic react project using babel and webpack, made to test the communication between parent and child components.

The app contains a rectangle component (`Rectangle`) whose color can be changed through a sibling controller component (`RectangleManager`). Both components get their initial color property through their parent (`MyApp` component).

## Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. Open `dist/index.html` in the browser
